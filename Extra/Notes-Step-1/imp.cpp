// for running any C++ code, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Here is a simple example of a C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Let the name of file be hello.cpp and want to have exe file of name hello : 
// --> Command to compile: g++ -o hello hello.cpp

//--> Execute : .\hello.exe

// For all directories : #include <bits/stdc++.h>


// lec : 4 -->  Armstrong Number : the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. Eg : 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3


// in Hashing, max size for array is : 1e6 i.e 10^6 inside main and 1e7 i.e 10^7 outside main
// so for number hashing we have some limit, we prefer unordered map firstly then map (if TLE occurs then map, else first choice is unorder map ans best/avgt case in mostly cases is O(1) and worst sometimes is : O(N))
