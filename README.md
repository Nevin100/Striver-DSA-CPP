<h1 align="center">🚀  DSA with Striver in C++</h1>

Welcome to my personal space where I’m diving deep into **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **C++**, guided by **Striver’s DSA A2Z Sheet**.

This repository will serve as my structured log —  solving DSA problems, writing clean C++ code, and staying consistent, one day at a time.

## 💡 Motivation

With the goal of strengthening problem-solving skills and becoming interview-ready, I’m committing to this 100-day challenge — no shortcuts, just consistent effort.

Whether it’s arrays, linked lists, trees, or graphs — everything will be covered, understood, and implemented.
