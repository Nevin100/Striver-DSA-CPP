//Time Complexity Fundamentals: 

//Time complexity :  the rate at which the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.

//1.) Big - O Notation : worst case or upper- bound
//(Note : time complexity is calculated in terms of worst case scenerios usually, avoid constants and avoid lower values)

// example : 
//for(int i =0; i<n; i++){ cout << "Nevin"}; ---> O(3n) {n times for loop and 3 times extra for sum (cout statement,check,increment step of i) };

//2.) Theta - Notation : average complexity
//3.) Omega-Notatiuon : best case complexity

//Space Complexity : space complexity is the amount of space required by an algorithm to run.

//1.)Auxiliary Space : space that you take to solve the problem
//2.)Input Space : space you took to store the input.

//Example : c = a + b; --->(here c : Auxiliary space and a & b are input space0)
